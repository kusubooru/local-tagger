This is a user interface for the 'Bulk Add CSV' extension of Shimmie2.

Assuming a folder containing images, it will launch an interface that will
allow to add tags, source and rating on each image. Upon clicking the save
button, it will create a CSV file containing the image metadata. The folder
containing the CSV file and the images can then be uploaded on the server and
used by the 'Bulk Add CSV' Shimmie2 extension to add the images in bulk.
