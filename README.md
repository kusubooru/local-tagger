This is a user interface for the 'Bulk Add CSV' extension of Shimmie2 which
aims to help in the creation and modification of the CSV file. Taking a folder
containing images as input, it will launch an interface that will allow to tag
the images. Upon save it will recreate the CSV file with the new info.
